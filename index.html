                You need to walk before you can run. So to ease you into SaveSmart,

            <p>
                If you want to save, you need a clear idea of what&#39;s coming in and where your cash is
                going out. Before we start thinking about paying off debt, a week away in the sun or
                your dream house, all of us first need to know where our money is going before we can
                put any of it aside.

            <h4>Can it be a bit scary to fully understand your financial picture?</h4>
            <p>
                Absolutely! But it&#39;s an important first step before you can start to create that budget. You might
                be
                worried about how much you owe or how much you are spending, but this is the first big step for you
                to create a more positive financial future.

                vs. your monthly incomings. If your outgoings surpass your incomings, then you need to take a look at
